Problems:
- solve vocabulary bug
- <person> tag in our data gets split up into three tokens!
- Regular softmax version fails terribly on small datasets. Maybe due to the dirty fix of the hidden layer size :(


Implement some kind of validation that is run once in a while to do early stopping!!!



Add weighting of padding to avoid training on padding loss?

- Adapt Cornell dataset to test mode

- Full run on the baseline
- Measure/quantify the limitations of the baseline model

Stage2:
- Re-include attention (one line)
- extend model with other idea(s)
