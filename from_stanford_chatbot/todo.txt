Vocab sizes with threshold 2, sentence lengths 16,19
- Cornell ~25k
- Our data ~33k

Corpus sizes, no length limit:
- Cornell ~ 190k
- Our data ~ 360k

Corpus sizes, sentence lenghts 16,19:
- Cornell ~ 105k
- Our data ~ 170k 



Problems:
- <person> tag in our data gets split up into three tokens!
- Regular softmax version fails terribly on small datasets. Maybe due to the dirty fix of the hidden layer size :(

Add weighting of padding to avoid training on padding loss?

Build vocabulary based on the sentences that actually fit in the buckets.
	Pro: Smaller input and output layer, should be a little bit faster
	Con: Each max bucket size change requires reloading the entire dataset


- Make it possible to use both datasets at once
- Implement vector extrama metric.
- Use perplexity metric for validation?

- Measure/quantify the limitations of the baseline model
	--> inituitive: Variety of the answers is quite small. All the answers are pretty generic and short

Stage2:
- Re-include attention (one line) - Should we do this now? Maybe that would help improve the quality of the model
- extend model with other idea(s)

-extend training to triples
