1. Create a virtual environment, make sure you use python version 2.7.
	Something like: virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python2.7 old_tf

2. Activate that environment: source old_tf/bin/activate

3. Find the correct wheel for your machine here https://tensorflow.blog/2016/11/13/tensorflow-v0-11-release/
		and follow the instructions on the page. Avoid the sudo when calling pip if possible, that can cause problems

4. That's it :)
